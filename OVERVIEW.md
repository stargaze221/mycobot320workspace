# üß† Intelligent Robotics with Low-Cost Hardware

### Using ML, Computation, and Sensing to Overcome Mechanical Limitations

---

## üåç Motivation

Affordable robots such as **MyCobot 320**, entry-level manipulators, or small mobile platforms suffer from:

* Noisy encoders and weak actuators
* Uncertain kinematics and dynamics
* Lack of precise calibration

Instead of upgrading the mechanics, we **close the precision gap through intelligence** ‚Äî combining
modern computation, sensing, and learning inside a unified **ROS 2** ecosystem.

## üß© Key Insight

> **Information can substitute for precision.**

High-end robots reduce uncertainty by mechanical accuracy.
Our system reduces uncertainty by **information flow**:

* Fusing external vision with proprioception
* Using learned models to correct dynamics
* Planning motions robust to uncertainty

Thus, computation and sensing become the ‚Äúprecision hardware.‚Äù

## üî¨ Research Vision

This framework demonstrates that:

* **Learning + Modeling** can adaptively compensate for cheap sensors/actuators.
* **State Estimation + Perception** convert noisy measurements into actionable belief states.
* **Planning + Control** exploit model confidence for safe, efficient behavior.
* **ROS 2 Integration** scales easily from simulation (Pinocchio + MeshCat) to hardware (MyCobot / RC Car / UAV).

Ultimately, it lays the foundation for **adaptive, uncertainty-aware robotics** ‚Äî
bridging low-cost platforms with high-level intelligence.
