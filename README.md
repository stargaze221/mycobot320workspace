Perfect timing ✅ — let’s create a **top-level `README.md`** that introduces your project clearly and connects all supporting documents in your repo (e.g., `Dependency.md`, `UdevRules.md`, `HardwareSetup.md`, etc.).

Here’s a polished draft you can drop into your repository root:

# 🤖 MyCobotProject Documentation

### Intelligent Robotics with Low-Cost Hardware

**Using ML, Computation, and Sensing to Overcome Mechanical Limitations**

---

## 🌍 Motivation

Affordable robots such as **MyCobot 320**, entry-level manipulators, or small mobile platforms often suffer from:

* Noisy or low-resolution encoders
* Weak actuators and backlash
* Uncertain kinematics and dynamics
* Lack of precise calibration

Instead of upgrading the mechanics, we **close the precision gap through intelligence** — combining computation, sensing, and learning inside a unified **ROS 2** ecosystem.

## 🧠 Research Background and Approach

This repository explores a complete stack for intelligent calibration and control:

| Module                               | Description                                                                                       |
| :----------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **System Identification + Learning** | Use data-driven models (DNNs / GPs) to approximate uncertain robot dynamics.                      |
| **State Estimation**                 | Integrate cameras (RealSense, ZED 2i) and tactile feedback for landmark-based particle filtering. |
| **Planning under Uncertainty**       | Use Crocoddyl + Pinocchio for trajectory optimization and POMDP-inspired adaptation.              |
| **Human-Robot Interaction**          | Provide tactile and visual interfaces such as Braille map output and MeshCat visualization.       |

Our goal is to **demonstrate how software intelligence compensates for mechanical limitations** — yielding precise motion, adaptive behavior, and safe operation even with low-cost hardware.

## ⚙️ Expected Output

After completing setup:

* ✅ MyCobot 320 operates under closed-loop motion control
* ✅ Sensors stream data through ROS 2 topics (camera, IMU, encoders)
* ✅ NVBlox + SLAM reconstruct a 3D scene and occupancy map
* ✅ Pinocchio + Crocoddyl visualize optimal trajectories in MeshCat
* ✅ Optional tactile output (Braille display) provides environmental awareness

Would you like me to generate the companion markdown stubs (`Dependency.md`, `UdevRules.md`, `HardwareSetup.md`, etc.) next — each with a minimal structure and TODO placeholders so you can fill them in gradually?
